# Booze Calc
##Buying booze? Get the most bang for your buck.

###Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a tool to calculate the best bargain in terms of alcohol content in relation to money.

###Background
We all have our preferences when money is no object. But sometimes we have to shop for a party or band practice. and it can be helpful to know how to spend the last $20--whether to buy beer or whiskey or whether you can get a really good deal on a premium brand.

###Development
This calculator is built mobile first. It must be useable and convenient on your phone in the liquor store. I haven't done extensive device testing, but I am open to tweaks to help out any modern device. Minimum styling and native form elements are preferred.
